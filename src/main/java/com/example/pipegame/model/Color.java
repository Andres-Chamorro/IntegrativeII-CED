// The code snippet is defining an enumeration called `Color`. An enumeration is a special type in Java
// that represents a fixed set of constants. In this case, the `Color` enumeration has three constants:
// `WHITE`, `GRAY`, and `BLACK`. These constants can be used to represent different colors in the
// context of the `pipegame` model.
