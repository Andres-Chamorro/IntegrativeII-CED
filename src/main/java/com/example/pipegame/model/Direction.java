// The code snippet is defining an enumeration called `Direction`. An enumeration is a special type in
// Java that represents a fixed set of constants. In this case, the `Direction` enumeration represents
// the four cardinal directions: UP, DOWN, RIGHT, and LEFT. These constants can be used to represent
// the direction of movement in a game or any other scenario where direction is important.
public enum Direction {
    UP,
